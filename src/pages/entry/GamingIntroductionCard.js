                I'm also an avid gamer, especially when it comes to competitive and team-based games that require strategy, coordination, and resilience.
                I enjoy working under pressure, staying focused, and motivating othersâ€”especially when the odds are against us.
                I strongly believe that, with the right mindset, any game can still be turned around.
                That same persistence drives how I approach complex projects in tech.
